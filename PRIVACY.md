# Privacy Policy

This plugin is designed with privacy and security as top priorities. While we utilize LLM services for dialogue processing and HTML code generation, we maintain strict privacy standards for all user interactions.

## Data Collection and Processing

- **Temporary Dialogue Processing**: We only process the conversation content during the active dialogue session.
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or process any personal information beyond the dialogue context.
- **No Usage Tracking**: We do not track or monitor how you use the dialogue agent.
- **No Analytics**: We do not implement any analytics or tracking mechanisms.
- **HTML Rendering**: Generated HTML code is only rendered locally in your browser and is not sent to other servers.

## Data Transmission

- All data transmission is conducted through secure channels
- Conversation content is only transmitted to the configured LLM service
- Dialogue state is temporarily stored and automatically cleared upon completion
- Rendered HTML content is processed locally and not transmitted elsewhere

## Third-Party Services

This plugin uses LLM services for natural language processing and HTML code generation. Please note:
- We use the configured LLM service as specified in your setup
- No user identification or tracking is involved
- For the LLM service's privacy practices, please refer to your chosen provider's privacy policy

## Security Measures

- All API requests are made using secure protocols
- Dialogue states are stored with unique, temporary keys
- Conversation data is processed in real-time and cleared after completion
- Storage keys are randomly generated and session-specific
- HTML code in the web interface executes locally and does not access your system files

## User Rights

- You have complete control over what information you choose to share
- Dialogue state is automatically cleared upon completion
- You can stop the conversation at any time without data residue
- You can request to clear your dialogue state at any point

## Data Retention

- Dialogue state is only retained during the active conversation
- All conversation data is automatically cleared upon completion
- No historical conversation data is permanently stored
- Rendered HTML content is not saved
